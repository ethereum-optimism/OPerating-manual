# Season 7: Anticapture Commission Charter Amendment Proposal

The Anticapture Commission was conceptualized and formally introduced as a Meta-governance structure in Season 5 of Governance, with a view towards preventing capture across the Optimism Collective, while simultaneously representing the interests of key individual delegates. Originally, the Anticapture Commission Charter was authorized to operate for two seasons, and carried forward into Season 6. Now at the completion of Season 6, the Anticapture Commission Charter is being proposed for renewal. If approved by the Token House, the Anticapture Commission would be delegated 10M OP from the Governance Fund in Season 7 and 8. The Anticapture Commission will not have an operating budget. 

If this proposal is approved, it will supersede any earlier Charter for the Anticapture Commission.

# Goals of the Anticapture Commission

1. Act as a governance structure composed of high-context delegates, with an aim towards preventing capture in the Token House or across the Collective: The Commission is expected to brainstorm and identify areas of capture occurring in the collective, and proactively discuss among its members ways in which capture can arise and how to mitigate such circumstances.
2. In furtherance of Goal No. 1, the ACC shall provide alerts to the Citizens’ House when concerns arise over significant imbalances in power between groups of stakeholders. Any member of the Collective may flag a concern to be considered by the Anticapture Commission via the commission’s email or through the governance forum.
3. Vote on all proposals that are subject to a Citizens House veto: Exercising the Commission’s delegation is important to passing Protocol Upgrades and other proposals subject to Citizens’ House veto. Hence, the Commission is expected to cast its vote on all such proposals.
4. Vote on other proposals that are not subject to a Citizens House veto: In situations where the Delegate Members of the ACC believe a capture is occurring or is likely to occur, or it would be in the interest of the Optimism Collective for the ACC to signal its voting intention, the Commission may also cast its vote on proposals that are not subject to a Citizens House Veto.
5. Act as a communication bridge between the Token House and the Citizens House: While the Anticapture Commission provides its duties in service to the token house, its alerts during instances of capture form an important input for any Citizen’s House Veto. Hence, the Anticapture Commission will seek to act as a bridging governance structure between the two houses of Governance, and in furtherance of this goal, the Anticapture Commission and its Delegates will seek to be part of Citizens House discussions in instances where the Citizens House considers a veto during the veto period.
6. The Anticapture Commission could additionally assist with the Milestone based Decentralization Model proposed by Foundation by being responsible to evaluate progress of decentralization across the layer and ensuring the various decentralization objectives are met. Also, the ACC can play a role in shepherding Phase II & Phase III, as outlined in the Accelerating Decentralization Proposal.

## Commission Structure

The Anticapture Commission would be composed of high impact delegates. Anticapture Commission votes would be cast based on the process finalized by member delegates which will be outlined in the Commission’s Internal Operating Procedures (IOP) at the start of the Season.

## Signing Structure

The Anticapture Commission will operate a X of Y Gnosis Safe Multisig, where X represents the threshold as agreed to by the Members of the Commission in the IOP for the season, and Y represents the total number of Delegate Members who are part of the Commission. 

Presently, the ACC Multisig is deployed on the Optimism Network with the contract address: [0x3EEe61B92C36e97Be6319BF9096A1ac3c04a1466](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3EEe61B92C36e97Be6319BF9096A1ac3c04a1466) as a 10-of-25 Multisig, and this is subject to change as per future season’s membership, and as per the IOP approved by members of the Anticapture Commission. 

The Anticapture Commission will also operate a Snapshot Space for achieving internal quorum on various decisions and proposals. 


## Signing Actions

The Commission’s Multisig and Snapshot Spaces will be operated in accordance with the Internal Operating Procedure agreed to by the members of the Commission. The Commission’s Multisig will be solely used to exercise its vote or signal on Governance proposals, using the OP tokens delegated to the Multisig. The Commission shall not be authorized to make other transactions from its Multisig such as transfers or grants of any kind.

## Membership

Membership will be determined based on the below criteria at the beginning of each Season.

1. Members must be an individual or professional delegate and not a representative of a protocol or corporation.
2. Members, as described above, must be in the top 100 delegates AND

3. All qualifying members must opt-in to be part of the Commission. Any qualifying member may choose not to opt-in for any reason. If less than 50% of qualifying members choose not to opt-in before the start of Season 7, the Commission may be reconsidered.

All members will need to KYC to vote as a member of the Anticapture Commission

4. Participate in any discussion with the Citizens House during the Citizens House Veto Period, if the Commission has alerted the Citizens House to any potential capture in the Token House.

4. If the total number of ACC members falls below 10, the Foundation will remove delegation.

# Budget of the Anticapture Commission

The Anticapture Commission does not have any operating budget. However, Delegate Members of the Anticapture Commission can expect that their time and effort in participation towards the Commission, and maintaining a 50% voting participation in the Commission’s votes throughout the season will be considered as a contributing input towards any potential Retro Governance Participation Rewards for the Season.
