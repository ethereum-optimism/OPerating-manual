# Seasons 8 & 9 Developer Advisory Board Charter v1.4

This Charter outlines the structure and responsibilities of the Developer Advisory Board and its participants. It is authored and maintained by the Optimism Developer Advisory Board.

This is the Seasons 8 & 9 Charter, which supersedes and replaces the Charters of all previous Seasons.

---

## Goals

The Developer Advisory Board (DAB) exists to provide independent, expert technical judgment to secure and advance the Optimism Collective. We have three overarching goals:

1.  **Serve as the Collective's primary technical approval body for Protocol Upgrades**, ensuring they are secure, well-reasoned, and aligned with the Collective's long-term interests.
2.  **Enhance the security of the Superchain ecosystem** by operating a dedicated Audit Grants Program.
3.  **Provide expert technical guidance** to support other strategic funding and grant-making initiatives within the Collective.

## Participants

### Board Composition and Election Terms

- The Developer Advisory Board shall consist of at least seven (7) members.
- Members will be elected for a 12-month term (covering Seasons 8 and 9) via a Joint House election, with votes from both the Token House and the Citizens' House.
- There are no term limits for representatives, but they may be implemented in the future if the need arises.

### Eligibility and Conflicts of Interest

To ensure the board's independence and ability to hold the core development process accountable, candidates may not be affiliated with core development entities. This means candidates may not be affiliates of OP Chains or organizations that have long-term development grants with the Foundation.

## Responsibilities

The DAB's responsibilities are divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary functions.

### Primary Function: Protocol Upgrade Approval

The DAB's core responsibility is to vote on all Protocol Upgrades on behalf of the Collective. This vote is optimistically approved, meaning an upgrade approved by the DAB will pass unless it is overridden (vetoed) by one of the Collective's stakeholder groups as defined in the Operating Manual.

A **5/7 approval vote** from the DAB is required for a Protocol Upgrade to pass.

When voting, the DAB is responsible for assessing the following characteristics of a protocol upgrade:

1.  **Technical Content:**

    - Does the code do what the proposal says it will do?
    - Is the proposal complete and does the on-chain calldata match what is described?
    - Does the proposal follow the established governance process?
    - _Note: The DAB is not responsible for conducting new audits or identifying novel malicious code, but for verifying the proposal's integrity based on existing information and its expertise._

2.  **Technical Merits:**

    - Is the justification for all changes clear and well-reasoned?
    - Are the proposal's described benefits accurate?
    - Does the proposal introduce technical trade-offs that are not mentioned or that may outweigh the benefits?
    - Are there other technical considerations the proposal author has omitted?

3.  **Collective Impact:**
    - Does the upgrade violate the values laid out in the Collective’s Working Constitution or the Law of Chains?
    - Does the upgrade meaningfully and negatively impact or disadvantage any of the Collective’s stakeholder groups?

### Secondary Function: Audit Grants Program

To enhance the security of the Superchain, the DAB will take full ownership of and operate the Collective's Audit Grants Program. This program is decoupled from other seasonal intents (e.g., TVL) and focuses on reducing the risk of smart contract exploits within the ecosystem. The DAB is responsible for:

- Proposing and managing a dedicated budget to provide subsidized audits to qualifying projects.
- Defining and managing the application process, review criteria, and selection of recipients for the Audit Grants Program.

### Tertiary Functions: Collective Advisory

In addition to its primary and secondary duties, board members are expected to contribute to the Collective's health through other advisory functions as needed. These may include:

- Collaborating with the Optimism Foundation on strategic technical initiatives.
- Providing technical feedback and diligence to the Grants Council.
- Supporting builders in the ecosystem through initiatives like technical office hours.

### Lead Responsibilities

The Lead is responsible for ensuring the board operates effectively and meets its objectives. This includes:

- (a) leading all board meetings and facilitating internal decisions.
- (b) ensuring the Protocol Upgrade voting process is conducted efficiently and transparently.
- (c) overseeing the board's primary, secondary, and tertiary functions.
- (d) acting as the primary point of contact for the board and communicating its decisions to the Collective.
- (e) tracking performance and drafting the end-of-term retrospective.

### Resignation Process

1. If a member wishes to resign before the end of their term, they must communicate this change to the Lead at least 7 days prior to this change taking effect.
2. Their position will be offered to the non-elected candidate who received the most votes in the Joint House election. If this individual is no longer available or interested, we will continue down the list of candidates in order of votes received. If no suitable candidate can be found, the Lead may appoint a replacement for the remainder of the term.
3. The Lead will then adjust quorum as needed and communicate the change through the structure’s Communication Thread.

### Accountability

- All Developer Advisory Board members are subject to Representative Removal as outlined in the Operating Manual. Removal votes will occur before the end of the next voting cycle. A contingent vote for their replacement on the Council will run in the same voting cycle. Please see [Representative Structure Framework](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-representative-structure-framework/5884) for additional details about edge cases related to removal.
- All representatives may be removed from their position for failing to uphold the responsibilities outlined in the relevant Charter or for failing to act with honesty, integrity, and transparency. If there is a vote to remove a representative, the Lead, or a simple majority of the remaining membership, may appoint a replacement for the remainder of the term.
- The Developer Advisory Board will conduct a retrospective at the end of term which will be posted to the forum by the last day of the term.
- While persistent structures will be assumed to be renewed each Season, delegates may submit Dissolution Proposals if they believe a persistent structure is no longer fulfilling its mandate and should be discontinued.

### Budget

An Operating Budget will be proposed by the Lead after this Charter amendment is approved by Optimism Governance. The budget will include a separate allocation for the Audit Grants Program. The Lead may propose a budget that contains variable rewards for members, provided that the evaluation algorithm for rewards is approved by a simple majority of members by the end of the first month of the term.

### Iteration

The canonical version of Charters for persistent structures will be published to GitHub. Any material updates to the Charter will be reflected with a new version number at the top of this document, at which point the updated version will go into effect.

This Charter must seek governance approval for changes to the mandate, scope, or budget approved by Optimism Governance.

It should finally be reiterated that the role of all structures are intended to be progressively and programmatically reduced over time, as its functionalities are no longer needed or can be effectively managed by other means. Ultimately, it is the goal of the Collective to reach a state of protocol and governance reliability that allows for the full and final dissolution of any non-essential structures.
