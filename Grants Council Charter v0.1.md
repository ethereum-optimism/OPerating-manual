This Charter outlines the structure and responsibilities of the Grants Council and its participants. It is authored and maintained by the Optimism Grants Council.

This is the Season 7 Charter, which supersedes and replaces the Charters of all previous Seasons.

### Goals

The Grants Council will allocate funds from the Governance Fund to support projects that drive measurable progress in the following success metrics for the Superchain:

* Support projects that drive measurable growth in the following metrics for the Superchain:
  * Increase Total Value Locked (TVL) denominated in ETH.
  * Increase Stablecoin TVL across the Superchain.
  * Increase Wrapped Asset TVL across the Superchain.
  * Increase Bridged Asset TVL across the Superchain.
* Create a streamlined and consistent process for grant applicants.
* Empower high-context delegates to make high-context grant decisions.
* Reduce the workload of non-Council delegates to enable their focus on high-impact votes.
* Coordinate with the Developer Advisory Board (DAB) and the Milestones and Metrics Council (MaM):
  * Ensure seamless information sharing to enable the DAB’s audit reviews and the MaM’s grant delivery operations.

Non-Goals:

* Retroactive funding (managed by a separate team).
* Programs that do not align with Superchain TVL metrics.

### Structure

### Normal Circumstances

  *  GrantNerds: Conducted by generalist reviewers to assess eligibility, alignment and guidance to applicants.
  * Final Review: Conducted by professional DeFi reviewers to evaluate TVL-driving potential.

### Iteration

4. Reduction Over Time:

      *  The role of the Grants Council, as with all structures, is intended to be progressively reduced over time as its functions are automated or absorbed by other mechanisms.
