# OPerating Manual of the Optimism Collective

This repository contains the OPerating Manual of the [Optimism Collective](http://optimism.io/vision)--our large-scale experiment in digital democratic governance.

The OPerating Manual describes the current set of rules for the Optimism Collective's governance, as stewarded by the Optimism Foundation and empowered by the [Working Constitution of the Optimism Collective](https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55).

The OPerating Manual is a living document maintained by the Optimism Foundation. We [encourage frequent iteration and feedback](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/r888e4B5iiNQi-3_mO26ixgv-plQ099XWgqEOv9iWKA), and the manual is published here on github to encourage transparency and community feedback.
