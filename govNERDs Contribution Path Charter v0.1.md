# Contribution Path Charter: govNERDs Charter S7

This Charter outlines the structure and responsibilities of the govNERDs and its participants.

This is a Contribution Path Charter.  This Charter clearly outlines the scope and responsibilities of the Contribution Path so the program can be more effectively managed by the community but it does not mean that the contribution path inherits the properties of elected Councils (which operate under Council Charters.)   

All contribution paths are open to the community and are not executed by elected representatives. Anyone interested in governance and willing to engage in community activities can join the govNERD Contribution Path if they meet the requirements outlined in our [governance docs](https://community.optimism.io/contribute/contribution-path/govnerds).

## Mission Statement

The govNERDs aim to reduce the Foundation's role in core governance operations by reliably and efficiently executing and facilitating core governance operations. 

## Goals

2. 100% of questions are answered in less than 48hr in: 1)gov-general, 2)delegate-discussion, 3)retrofunding-discussion
3. Publish voting cycle guides for every voting cycle with minimal edits by the Foundation
4. Publish voting cycle roundups for every voting cycle with minimal edits by the Foundation
5. Organize at least 1 support call for RF applicants for each RF round 
6. Issues that require Foundation response are escalated to the Foundation within 48 hours

### **Develop and document clear processes for governance operations execution**

1. Develop and update Internal Operating Procedures documents for all recurring tasks of the  govNERDs execution. 

### **Create clear pathways for community members to contribute meaningfully**

## Structure

### Signing Structure

The govNERDs will operate under the Lead's direction without a multisig structure, as the scope of work is operational rather than financial in nature. govNERDs may manage a voting multisig, to assist with voting cycle management, in the future.

### Normal Circumstances

The govNERDs will:

- Execute governance operational tasks according to established procedures
- Maintain communication channels and documentation
- Provide support to the community through designated channels
- Report progress, metrics, issues and relevant conversations to the Foundation

### Emergency Circumstances

While the govNERDs do not have emergency powers, they will escalate urgent governance operations issues to the Foundation or relevant structures as needed.
