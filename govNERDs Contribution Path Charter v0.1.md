# Contribution Path Charter: govNERDs Charter S8/9 (v0.2)

This Charter outlines the structure and responsibilities of the govNERDs and its participants for Seasons 8 and 9.

This is a Contribution Path Charter. This Charter clearly outlines the scope and responsibilities of the Contribution Path so the program can be more effectively managed by the community, but it does not mean that the contribution path inherits the properties of elected Councils (which operate under Council Charters).   

All contribution paths are open to the community and are not executed by elected representatives. Anyone interested in governance and willing to engage in community activities can join the govNERD Contribution Path if they meet the requirements outlined in our [governance docs](https://community.optimism.io/contribute/contribution-path/govnerds).

## Mission Statement

The govNERDs aim to facilitate effective governance participation and reduce the Foundation’s operational burden by reliably and efficiently executing core governance operations.

2. Execute 100% of multisig transactions within 72 hours with 0 security incidents 
3. Escalate issues requiring Foundation response within 48 hours  
4. Maintain Grants Council operational support with >7/10 satisfaction

## Key Performance Indicators

> These, in addition to goal completion, measure the success of the govNERDs

- Grants Council satisfaction score (target: >7/10)  
- Number of security incidents on the Operating Budget multisig (target: 0)

## Structure

### Specialty Areas

The govNERDs program organizes around specialty areas to ensure comprehensive coverage of governance operations:

- **Token House Operations**: Token House votes, delegate communications, proposal tracking  
- **Citizens' House Operations**: Citizens' House votes, citizen communications  
- **Cross-House Support**: Supporting both Houses during joint initiatives  

### Signing Structure

Three core govNERDs will serve as signers on the Operating Budget multisig. Each signer is responsible for reviewing and executing transactions, representing a significant increase in responsibility and trust within the Collective. Signers are selected based on demonstrated reliability and understanding of governance operations.

### Normal Circumstances

The govNERDs will:

- Execute governance operational tasks across both Houses  
- Support the Grants Council through integrated grantNERD responsibilities  
- Maintain governance infrastructure and documentation  
- Monitor forums and Discord for relevant activity and escalations  
- Track and log feedback for reflection period analysis  
- Provide public support and onboarding pathways  

### Emergency Circumstances

While the govNERDs do not hold emergency powers, they are responsible for escalating urgent governance issues or security concerns to the Foundation or relevant structures within 48 hours.

## Participants

### Cohorts and Terms

The govNERDs structure consists of:

- 1 Lead  
- 3 Core govNERDs  

Core govNERDs and the Lead are selected through an application process. To be eligible, applicants must hold a “Governance Contributor” or “govNERD” attestation to demonstrate proven competence in governance operations.  

Core govNERDs serve for two consecutive seasons (12 months) to promote program stability and build institutional knowledge.

### Budget Structure

- **Lead**: 20,000 OP per Season  
- **Core govNERDs**: 15,000 OP per Season  

### Budget Philosophy

The program’s compensation design is intended to:

- Attract and retain high-quality contributors  
- Reflect the expanded scope and professional nature of roles  
- Promote continuity through multi-season terms  
- Align with similar compensation levels across the Collective  

For specific budget details, refer to the approved Foundation Mission Request for Seasons 8 and 9.

## Iteration

The canonical version of this Charter will be published on the [Optimism Governance GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/).

This Charter will be in effect for Seasons 8 and 9 (12 months total). Updates and reviews will occur through:

- Monthly syncs between the Lead and Foundation  
- Bi-weekly syncs with the Grants Council  
- Quarterly cross-entity coordination meetings  
- Monthly internal meetings with all core govNERDs
